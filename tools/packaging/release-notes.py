"""Builds release notes from the Conventional Commit history since the last tag.

    release-notes.py <current-tag> [previous-tag]

Without a previous tag it finds the closest preceding `v*` tag, and falls back to
the whole history when there is none.

Subjects that are not conventional are kept under "Other changes" rather than
dropped. Everything before the convention was adopted looks like that, and a
release note that quietly omits half of what shipped is worse than an untidy one.
