# Builds the drag-to-Applications disk image from dist/Sandfort.app.

#
# The window layout comes from a committed .DS_Store rather than from driving
# Finder with AppleScript at build time. Finder scripting needs a real desktop
# session and a volume mounted where Finder can see it; on a CI runner that is
# either flaky or impossible. Capturing the layout once and replaying it is
# deterministic and needs nothing but hdiutil.
#
# To change the layout, mount a read-write image, arrange it in Finder, and copy
# the resulting .DS_Store over tools/packaging/dmg-layout.DS_Store. The positions
# are keyed by filename, so "Sandfort.app" and "Applications" must keep those
# exact names.
