"""Reads named fields out of a 1Password item exported as JSON.

    read-1password-export.py FILE --check NAME...   validate; print name<TAB>length
    read-1password-export.py FILE --value NAME      write one value to stdout

A separate file rather than a heredoc inside the shell script. Quoting a Python
program through several layers of shell is how that script ended up with a
syntax error nobody could see.
